>  This chapter defines the terminology used by the Verilog PLI and how PLI applications which use the VPI library are interfaced to Verilog simulators. 
>
> All remaining chapters in Part One of this book assume the principles covered in this chapter are understood. The general concepts presented are:  
>
> - PLI terms as used with the VPI library  
> - System tasks and system functions
> - How VPI routines work  
> - A complete PLI application example  
> - Interfacing PLI applications to Verilog simulators
