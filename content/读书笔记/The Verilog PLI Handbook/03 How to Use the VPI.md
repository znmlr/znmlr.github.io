## *The VPI routine library*

- `â€œVPI` stands for `Verilog Procedural Interface`

- The VPI routines are the third of the three generations of the Verilog PLI routines (the TF routines were the first generation, and the ACC routines were the second).
- The primary purpose of the VPI routines is to provide a PLI application access to the internal data structures of a simulation.

The VPI library can be divided into five basic groups of routines:

- A **handle** routine obtains a handle for one specific Verilog HDL object.

- An **iterate** routine and a **scan** routine obtain handles for all of a specific type of Verilog object.

- **get** routines access information about an object.

- **set** routines modify information about an object.

- A few **miscellaneous** routines perform a variety of operations

The library of VPI routines is defined in a C header file called **vpi_user.h**, which is part of the IEEE 1364 standard. This header file also defines a number of C constants and C structures used by the VPI routines. All PLI applications which use VPI routines must include the vpi_user.h file.

The VPI library is designed to work with the standard ANSI C libraries, such as **stdlib.h**, **stdio.h** and **stdarg.h.** 

## *Advantages of the VPI library*

- The VPI library is a concise set of 37 routines. These routines have a very simple and consistent syntax, and are easy to learn and use.
